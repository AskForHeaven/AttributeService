# AttributeService
AttributeService - inspired whole heartedly by RuizuKun_Dev's AttributeService - is a custom Roblox service geared towards adding extra methods to Attributes in order to make them more user-friendly. This includes things like "ClearAllAttributes", "GetChildrenWithAttribute", "FindFirstChildWithAttribute", among other things.

As a note, I made this spontaneously after seeing RuizuKun_Dev's AttributeService and was inspired to try making my own version, I am not making this with the intention of taking credit for their ideas.
